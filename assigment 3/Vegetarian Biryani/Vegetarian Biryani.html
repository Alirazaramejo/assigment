      Aloo Biryani is a flavorful and aromatic rice dish that originates from
      the Indian subcontinent. It is a vegetarian variation of the popular
      biryani, which traditionally includes meat or poultry. Aloo refers to
      potatoes, which are the main ingredient in this version.
    </p>
    <p>
      To prepare Aloo Biryani, basmati rice is cooked with a combination of
      spices, herbs, and vegetables, with potatoes being the star component. The
      potatoes are typically peeled, cubed, and cooked until they are tender and
      infused with the flavors of the spices.

    <p>
      The rice is parboiled separately and then layered with the cooked potatoes
      and spices in a large pot or biryani pot. Saffron strands, fried onions,
      and chopped mint leaves are often added to enhance the fragrance and taste
      of the dish. The pot is then sealed with a tight-fitting lid, and the
      biryani is cooked on low heat, allowing the flavors to meld together and
      the rice to fully cook.
