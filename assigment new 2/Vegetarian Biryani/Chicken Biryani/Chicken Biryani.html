    <h2 id="chick1">Hyderabadi Chicken Biryani</h2>
    <p>
      Hyderabadi Chicken Biryani is a renowned and flavorful rice dish that
      originates from the city of Hyderabad in India. It is a classic biryani
      preparation that combines succulent chicken with fragrant basmati rice,
      aromatic spices, and caramelized onions.
    </p>
    <p>
      To prepare Hyderabadi Chicken Biryani, the chicken is marinated in a
      mixture of yogurt, ginger, garlic, and a blend of spices such as cumin,
      coriander, turmeric, and red chili powder. The marinated chicken is then
      cooked until tender and infused with the flavors of the spices.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a separate pot, basmati rice is parboiled until partially cooked. The
      partially cooked rice is then layered with the cooked chicken and a blend
      of caramelized onions, saffron-infused milk, and fragrant spices like
      cardamom, cinnamon, and bay leaves. This layering process is repeated to
      create distinct layers of rice and chicken.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pot is then sealed with a tight-fitting lid, and the biryani is cooked
      on low heat, allowing the flavors to meld together and the rice to fully
      cook through the process of "dum" cooking. Dum cooking involves trapping
      the steam within the pot, which helps in infusing the rice and chicken
      with the aromatic flavors.
    </p>
